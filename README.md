# findBiomarkers

##Description
This project is done by Jing Tong (Computational Biology Ph.D. student at
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) during Insight health data
science progrom in July 2015. Collaberated with Sage Bionetworks to find the
important factors for sepsis resilience.


##Requirements
**findBiomarkers requires the following python libraries to perform properly:**  
*matplotlib* - http://matplotlib.org/index.html  
*numpy* - http://www.numpy.org/  
*pandas* - http://pandas.pydata.org/  
*sklearn* - http://scikit-learn.org/stable/  

These may easily be installed using (Python) PIP. Intructions to install PIP -  
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing.html

##Execution
Executing findBiomarkers.py requires the user to input a few execution  
variables within the script itself for a successful execution. The variables  
are listed below with a description of what they are.

##Notes
There are two findBiomarkers scripts in this repository. Retained version 1  
which jing wrote, but version 2 is the working version. All documentation  
in this file refer to getting this code to work for version 2.

Placeholders for the arguments have been left to remain so that future users
can have clear examples of what belongs where.

##Arguments
**expressionDataFilename:** Path and name of the series matrix file. Can be  
downloaded directly from the data series link on GEO.  
**metadataFilename:** Path and name of the metadata file which is a  
TSV formatted file generated by getGeoMetadataSingle.py within the repository:  
https://github.com/rkweku/getGeoMetadata  
**groupColumnName:** The name of the column within the metadata file that has  
the information required to differentiate the various groups from one another.  
**groupOneDict:** The name of the the first group type being compared found  
under groupColumnName. Only the key must be modified here (just change what is  
contained within the '' in the brackets). Case sensitive so ensure it matches  
exactly what is in the metadata file.  
**groupTwoDict:** The name of the second group type being compared found under  
groupColumnName. Only the key must be modified here (just change what is  
contained within the '' in the brackets). Case sensitive so ensure it matches  
exactly what is in the metadata file.  
**outputFilename:** Path and name of the file to output the common gene list to.
